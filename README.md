This is an attempt at the bowling kata (http://programmingpraxis.com/2009/08/11/uncle-bobs-bowling-game-kata/) implemented at a meeting of the Sheffield .NET User Group on 05/09/2013. The kata is uncompleted and currently has one failing test for the point we got up to in the kata. The attendees at the meeting took turns in coding, where each person would fix a failing test, refactor, write a new failing test and then pass control to another attendee.

The Sheffield .NET User Group meets on the first Thursday of each month and is open to all levels of .NET user, including those who don't currently know any .NET languages but would like to learn. To find out more, follow @dotnetsheff on Twitter or see the Google group:
